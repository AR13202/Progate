		I've been interested in technology (mainly computers and other electronics) and programming for quite a while now. And although I enjoy programming as a hobby very much, I have some doubts of going into programming / software development as a career. Instead I'm aiming towards other computer careers like consulting or computer security. I also have my eyes (partially) set in finance and economics, although I don't know if I'll do as well in that career track because I'm more of a tech-y person. Now let me explain - I find programming as a hobby very interesting. I enjoy the problem solving that lies underneath it and I enjoy creating applications (especially Web applications) very time. However, the thing is, I don't enjoy working on large-scale projects. I have created one before and finished it, but once I get to a certain point, it just feels like all of the code is very unorganized and requires a complete rewrite.
